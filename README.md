My interests are Field Robotics, Applied machine learning, Large-language models, and AI-generated content (AIGC e.g., stable-diffusion).

This graph is generated by my custom web API that uses [serpapi](https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api) to obtain my scholar information and parsed using a simple python script hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you want to use this in your project, please have a look this [repo](https://github.com/inkyusa/google_scholar_citations)

### My Kaggle profile
---
Kaggle is one of my favourite places to learn and explore new machine learning (ML) technologies. I have found it to be a fun and entertaining playground where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems.

If you are also interested in ML or other state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies, I highly recommend checking out Kaggle. There are a wide range of challenging problems that need to be solved, and Kaggle provides a great platform for learning and collaboration.
