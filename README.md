My interests are Field Robotics, Applied machine learning, Large-language models, and AI-generated content (AIGC e.g., stable-diffusion).

### Highlight repos & projects
* [3D object retrival tutorial](https://github.com/inkyusa/3D_object_retrieval): a toy example for 3D model retreival either from text or image, both using CLIP embedding and FAISS indexing
* [deepNIR](https://inkyusa.github.io/deepNIR_dataset/): Dataset for generating synthetic NIR images and improved fruit detection system using deep learning techniques
* [Fork of Imitation learning algorithms and co-training for Mobile ALOHA](https://github.com/inkyusa/act_vel_added): many bug fixes, velocity feature added, more script for training, validation, and visualisation
* [weedNet](https://github.com/inkyusa/weedNet): Multispectral crop&weed dataset for semantic segmentation
* [deepFruits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enddl22/deepnir-11fruits): Kaggle hosted, 11 fruits bounding box annoration datasets
* [gym rotors](https://github.com/inkyusa/gym_rotor): Old (6yrs) but contains the fundamental toy examples for continuous RL control for a quadrotor

### My Kaggle profile
---
Kaggle is one of my favourite places to learn and explore new machine learning (ML) technologies. I have found it to be a fun and entertaining playground where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems.

If you are also interested in ML or other state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies, I highly recommend checking out Kaggle. There are a wide range of challenging problems that need to be solved, and Kaggle provides a great platform for learning and collaboration.
