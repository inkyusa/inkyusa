### My Kaggle profile
---
Kaggle is one of my favourite places to learn and explore new machine learning (ML) technologies. I have found it to be a fun and entertaining playground where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems.

If you are also interested in ML or other state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies, I highly recommend checking out Kaggle. There are a wide range of challenging problems that need to be solved, and Kaggle provides a great platform for learning and collaboration.
